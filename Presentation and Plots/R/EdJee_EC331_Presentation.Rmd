## Introduction

* Research aims to estimate the economic impact/cost of terrorism.
    + Currently only looking at the UK from 1970-2016.
* Using asset market responses as a proxy for economic costs.
    + Clear issues with this approach but offers best identification of terror response.
* Results so far suggest that only events at the tail of the terror distribution move markets significantly.

## The Big Picture - Why does this matter?

* Modern macro models often struggle to explain equity premium puzzle.
* Barro (2006) argues that incorporating rare disaster 'black swan' risk can solve this.
* Previous literature either treats disasters as endogenous e.g. measuring a disaster as >10% fall in GDP or uses warfare as a proxy for disaster.
* The UK has been involved with a handful of conflicts since 1980 but subjected to `r nrow(terror.data)` terror attacks.
* An estimate of the cost and distribution of terror attacks would let us test the hypothesis that terror attacks can help explain this puzzle.

## Methodology
* Event Study

    + Calculating Cumulative Abnormal Returns and then taking an average across events to get a Cumulative Average Abnormal Return.
    
* Non-parametric approach
    + Kernel regression on index returns to produce an empirical distribution of returns, compare post terror event returns to non-parametric conditional distribution to determine whether events can be labeled extreme.
    
## Event Study
```{r method.figure, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
#path.figure <- root.file('EME', 'R', 'plots', 'Event Study Method Figure.png')

```

![](C:/Users/ed/Documents/R Working Directory/Dissertation/EME/R/plots/Event Study Method Figure.png)

* Formulae for cumulative abnormal returns:
    + $AR_{i,\tau}=R_{i,\tau}-E[R_{i,\tau}\vert\Omega_{i,\tau}]$
    + $CAR_{i(\tau_{1},\tau_{2})}=\sum_{t=\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}} AR_{i,t}$
* And then taking an average: $CAAR_{(\tau_{1},\tau_{2})}=\frac{1}N \sum_{i=1}^{N} CAR_{i(\tau_{1},\tau_{2})}$ 

* There's a range of different ways of specifying $E[R_{i,\tau}\vert\Omega_{i,\tau}]$
* But for index data can only use constant mean return model.



## Terror Data

* Using terror data from the Global Terrorism Database compiled by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland.
    + Includes a range of variables such as wounded, killed, property damage, target, perpetrator group, ideology and weapon used.
    + All data from 1993 is missing - potentially quite problematic as 1993 Bishopsgate Bombing is one of the largest terror events ever on UK soil.
    + Since 1970 there have been `r nrow(terror.data)` events classed as terrorism by the GTD.
    + On average that implies an attack occurs every 6 days.
* Only two data transformations:
    + Terror attacks occurring on weekends (i.e. non-market days) moved to following Monday.
    + Construction of a terrorism intensity variable similar to Global Terrorism Index approach.


## Index Data

* Index data comes from Thomson Reuters' Datastream and is collected at the daily level.
    + UK indices include:
        + FTSE ALLSHARE, `r NROW(index.zoo.UK.ALLSHARE.omitted)` market day observations.
        + FTSE 100 (from 1983 onwards).
        + FT 30 (predecessor to the FTSE).
        + MSCI UK.
        + GBP:USD forex data.

## Conclusion/To Do

* Slicing data by industry rather than just looking at index data.
* Other stock market indicators such as volatility.
* Non-parametric approach and robustness/sensitivity checks.
* Come up with a model to link asset responses to economic costs.
    + Tobin's Q?
    + Consumption Euler equation, linking real returns on an asset to stochastic discount factor?
    + Lucas 'Tree' Asset Pricing model?
