\begin{abstract}
I show that large terror attacks do not have a significant negative
effect on UK asset markets. Furthermore, when I expand my analysis to
include all terror attacks from 1970 to present day I find no evidence
of a negative asset market response. Finally, I find no evidence of
event heterogeneity. That is, target type and location; success of an
attack; number of wounded or killed; weapons used; attack type and media
coverage cannot be used as predictors for asset market responses.
Results are consistent across a range of UK indices and specifications.

\pagestyle{plain}

Terror attacks in developed countries have long been studied by
economists as sources of exogenous shocks and events of interest in
their own right. However, comparatively little effort has been expended
exploring responses to the terror distribution outside of extreme tail
events such as 9/11 or London 7/7\footnote{To name a few studies
  concerned with large attacks, see Abadie and Dermisi (2008); Sandler
  and Enders (2008) or Draca, Machin, and Witt (2011). The full terror
  spectrum is studied in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003); Brodeur
  (Forthcoming) and Enders and Sandler (1991).}. This paper aims to
quantify the individual responses to all attempted terror attacks
occurring in the UK from 1970-2016 and estimate the determinants of
these responses.

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) (2016) defines terror attacks as the
threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state
actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through
fear, coercion, or intimidation. This definition admits two clear
economic channels through which the consequences of an attack propagate:
the direct effect is comprised of destruction of physical or human
capital, whilst the indirect effect deters investment and consumption
through increased uncertainty or heightened perception of terror risk,
rational or otherwise, as well as second-order effects such as greater
costs incurred due to increased border security or as a catalyst for
overseas intervention to disrupt terrorist organisations.

The UK is a natural candidate for terror analysis as a victim of both
extreme events such as the London 7/7 Bombings as well as a long history
of attacks due to the Troubles. Furthermore, the diverse nature of
terrorism in the UK, with attacks inspired by both Islamic extremism and
secessionist movements, suggests my results are likely to be externally
valid and can be applied across a number of western economies where
social and political discourse concerning terrorism is increasingly
prevalent. Finally, the GTD reports over 3000 terror attacks on UK soil
since 1970 as well as more than 100 attack variables providing ample
data with which to estimate terror responses. The high number of attacks
observed, however, is both a blessing and a curse, particularly when it
comes to estimating event heterogeneity, as many attacks have to be
discarded for fear of overlap and contamination of results. I employ a
range of methods to address this overlap problem however none are
entirely satisfactory.

Throughout the paper as a proxy for terror responses I use daily equity
index returns. This approach has a number of advantages over measuring a
more direct economic variable of interest such as GDP or unemployment.
Firstly, major UK indices are characterised by high liquidity and
volumes and hence offer a clear, almost instantaeneous identification of
agent reactions to terror attacks. Secondly, index prices, and therefore
returns, are a function of agents' beliefs about current and future cash
flows and therefore capture any changes in both direct and indirect
effects unlike a stock variable. Finally, index returns encompass a
broad range of firms within an economy and can be interpreted as a good
proxy for the stochastic discount factor used in many traditional macro
models.

I use two methods to estimate index responses to attacks. First, I apply
an event study methodology, which is commonly used in the finance
literature\footnote{A 2007 estimate puts the number of published papers
  in finance using an event study methodology at over 565 (Kothari and
  Warner 2007).}, to identify the effect of an event on asset prices or
returns. Event studies are particularly useful in this situation due to
their ability to handle small N, large T situations common to financial
time series and extreme event modelling. I calculate cumulative abnormal
returns (CARs) under the constant mean return model to quantify the
effects of the five largest terror attacks, measured by a weighted sum
of injuries and fatalities, and find mixed evidence of a significant
fall in index returns in four of the five cases but no significant fall
on aggregate. Then, I adapt Chesney, Reshetar, and Karaman (2011)'s
conditional probability approach within a bayesian setting and fail to
conclude that any of the five attacks cause an extreme or abnormal
movement in returns. Next, I apply the same methodologies to twenty of
the UK's largest attacks, stratified by decade, and again fail to reject
the null of significantly negative responses. Finally, I aggregate the
cumulative abnormal returns to find a terror attack cumulative average
abnormal return (CAAR) which, again, is not significantly different from
zero.

Estimating event heterogeneity produces broadly similar results. I
regress event CARs and event day returns on covariates such as weapons
used; event location; event target; number of killed or wounded; attack
success and a range of other variables using a Laplace prior to perform
Bayesian LASSO in order to overcome concerns of overfitting. Projection
predictive feature selection (Piironen and Vehtari 2017) suggests a
number of variables of interest such as media intensity and number of
injured provide the most predictive power when estimating event returns
but my tests lack the power to conclude that these variables are
different from 0 using 90\% credibility intervals.

Overall, it seems that index returns are resilient to terror attacks and
the effects of terror are negligible, whilst more work is needed to
definitively conclude that there is no event heterogeneity present.

\section{Literature Review}

\section{Methods and Results}\subsection{Event Study}

I use a standard event study approach, outlined by MacKinlay (1997),
where the event day is indexed by \(t = 0\). I first calculate abnormal
returns to give cumulative abnormal returns
\[ \begin{aligned} AR_{i,\tau} &=R_{i,\tau}-E[R_{i,\tau}\vert\Omega_{i,\tau}] \\
CAR_{i(\tau_{1},\tau_{2})} &=\sum_{t=\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}} AR_{i,t} \end{aligned}\]
where \(E[R_{i,\tau}\vert\Omega_{i,\tau}]\) is the expected index return
derived from the constant mean return model (the mean of index returns
within the estimation window) conditioning on information,
\(Omega_{i,\tau}\) common to all agents. The constant mean return model
can be written as \(R_{it} = \mu_i + \psi_{it}\), \(E(\psi_{it}) = 0)\)
\(var(\psi_{it}) = \sigma_{\psi_{it}}^2\). Whilst the constant mean
return model is the most simple,\footnote{compared to more advanced
  methods such as the market model which incorporates CAPM or
  multi-factor models building on Fama and French (1993)'s three factor
  model} it has been shown to perform similarly to these more advanced
models and has the advantage of being well defined for index returns
rather than individual securities which would be problematic under a
CAPM approach.

My estimation window contains twenty observations and ends ten days
before the event occurs. I choose an event window of 10 days
post-attack.
