# Introduction

### Research Objectives
 - Aim to estimate asset market responses to terror
    + Both short-term responses in the order of days or weeks.
    + Longer term responses to 'terror waves' e.g. Good Friday Agreement, rise of Islamic terror.

- Use a mixture of techniques to identify responses, primarily in a Bayesian setting.
    + Event study.
    + Hierarchical logistic regression.
    + Hierarchical shrinkage models.

- Short term responses are characterised by extreme heterogeneity.
    + Currently struggling to accurately pin this down.
- Long run responses TBC.
    

### Context

- Terrorism seems to have a negative effect on economies.
    + Abadie & Dimisi (2006) look at agglomeration economies of scale.
    + Abadie & Gardeazabal (2003) synthetic controls and ETA.
    + Enders & Sandler (2008) Spanish tourism VAR.
- Brodeur (Forthcoming) uses same dataset to address same question with a US focus.

### Context II

- There's a large amount of finance literature that explores asset market responses to large attacks.
    + Almost all the current work looks at big events such as the Barcelona bombings, 9/11 and 7/7.
- Tend to find that terror attacks act as a negative shock and banking sector is often most affected, Chesney et al. (2011).
- Not much evidence of firms adjusting terror expectations.
    + A terror shock today is pretty similar to one a decade ago and high intensity/high frequency windows aren't associated with any terror 'fatigue'.
- Zussman & Zussman (2006, 2008) find heterogenous asset market responses depending on type of attack.
    + Killing high ranking politicans causes the market to fall, killing generals causes a positive bump. (In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict)


# Methodology
## Event Study
### Event Study I
![Event Study Windows](C:/Users/ed/Documents/R Working Directory/EME-Dissertation/Presentation and Plots/R/plots/Event Study Method Figure.png)

* Formulae for cumulative abnormal returns:
    + $AR_{i,\tau}=R_{i,\tau}-E[R_{i,\tau}\vert\Omega_{i,\tau}]$
    + $CAR_{i(\tau_{1},\tau_{2})}=\sum_{t=\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}} AR_{i,t}$
* And then taking an average: $CAAR_{(\tau_{1},\tau_{2})}=\frac{1}N \sum_{i=1}^{N} CAR_{i(\tau_{1},\tau_{2})}$ 
* There's a range of different ways of specifying $E[R_{i,\tau}\vert\Omega_{i,\tau}]$
* But for index data can only use constant mean return model.

## Conditional Probability

### Conditional Probability Method I

- 'Pioneered' by Chesney, Reshetar and Karaman (CRK) in 2011 and never touched since.
- We have a conditional distribution:
$$
\pi(z|x) \equiv P(Z_i \leq z | X_i = x)
$$
- Where $Z_i$ are index returns and $X_i$ is a lagged vector of $Z_i$.
- Let $Y_i = I(Z_i \leq z)$ then $E(Y_i | X_i = x) = \pi(z|x)$.
- Basically a regression of $Y_i$ on $X_i$ will give us the probability, conditional on the value of lagged returns, of observing  $Z_i \leq z$.

### Conditional Probability Method II

- Applying this to terror attacks:
$$ 
Y_{it} = I(R_{it} \leq r_{i,terror})
$$
- where $R_{it}$ are the index returns and $r_{i,terror}$ is the observed event day terror return.
- Our $X_{it}$ variable is equal to $R_{i,t-1} - r_{i,pre\_terror}$, that is, lagged index values minus the return the day before the attack.

### Conditional Probability Method III

- In words:
    1. Take an event and calculate the event day return.
    2. For the 200 days preceding the event construct an indicator variable $Y_{it}$ that takes value $1$ if returns are lower than the event day return and $0$ otherwise.
    3. Our $X_{it}$ variable is found by lagging returns by one day and subtracting the return of the day $\textit{before}$ the event.
    4. Regress $Y_{it}$ on $X_{it}$ and plug in our event day return to obtain a fitted out-of-sample value.
- This fitted value can be thought of as the probability of observing a return on the day of the attack more extreme than the return actually observed.

### Conditional Probability Method IV

- CRK decide that an event is abnormal if there's less than a 10% probability of observing something worse than the event day return and extreme if less than 5%.
- The advantages of this method are that it's less susceptible to twiddling/p-hacking than the event study where a range of hyperparameters are set by the researcher. 
- CRK use a local polynomial regression to fit the model.
    + \textit{This can be considered a bad idea.}
- I instead use a logistic regression, however I immediately run into a problem.
- Some events are \textit{too} extreme.
    + There is 'separation' where our binary $Y$ variable always equals 0 for some events.


## Conditional Probability: A Bayesian Approach

### Bayesian Primer
- Bayesian econometrics relies on a researcher specifying his/her beliefs about likely parameter values (a prior) and a likelihood function. 
- We observe data $y$ conditional on some parameter(s) $\theta$. Using Bayes' rule:
$$
p(\theta | y) = \dfrac{p(y|\theta)\pi(\theta)}{p(y)}
$$
- Where $p(y) = \int{p(y|\theta)\pi(\theta)d\theta}$.
- Specifying a prior lets us overcome the problem of separation.
    + CRK use divine intervention/ignore the problem/an unpublished manuscript set to rock the econometrics world.

### No Pooling


- For each terror attack I estimate a separate logistic regression with 'weak' priors:
$$ 
\begin{aligned}
\alpha &\sim  N(0, 1) \\
\beta &\sim  t(\nu = 3, \mu =  0, \sigma = 2.5) \\ \\
y_i &\sim N(\alpha + \beta x_i, \epsilon_i)
\end{aligned}
$$
- $\alpha$ is the intercept prior and $\beta$ the slope prior.
- These are standard logistic weak priors from the literature e.g. Gelman et al. (2008), Ghosh et al. (2015).
    + Ghosh et al. deal specifically with the case of separation in logistic regression.



### Complete Pooling

- Combine the data from all terror attacks and estimate $\hat{\beta}$, this potentially helps increase the precision of our results and deal with separation.
- Interpretation becomes a little sketchy.
- All the variation in our fitted conditional probability estimates will only come from variation in event day returns and pre-event day returns.
- Identical priors to the no pooling case.

### Hierarchical Model

- Previously I set the distribution parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to some fixed constant that seemed reasonable.
- Instead I can give these priors their 'own' priors - hyperpriors.



$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_e &\sim N(\gamma_e, \sigma_\gamma) \\
\beta_e &\sim t(\nu = 3, \mu_e, \sigma_\mu) \\ \\
\gamma_e &\sim N(0.5, 0.5),\quad \sigma_\gamma \sim N(1, 5) \\
\mu_{e} &\sim N(0,1), \quad \sigma_\mu \sim N(2.5, 5) \\ \\
y_{ie} &\sim N(\alpha_e + \beta_ex_{ie},\sigma_{ye}^2 )
\end{aligned}
$$


### Hierarchical Model II

- This effectively means we partially pool the data.
- If the events are considered identical and there's no heterogeneity across attacks (our $\sigma_{\gamma,\mu} = 0$) the model is identical to the pooled model - we 'shrink' the estimates towards an overall average effect.
- However, if there is event heterogeneity present, estimates are not shrunk but allowed to vary i.e. shrinkage is inversely proportional to $\sigma_{\gamma,\mu}$.

### Hierarchical Model III

- You can think of this as there being some underlying population terror parameter $\Theta$.
- Each terror attack is a random draw from this $\Theta$ that we observe.
- Each individual attack gives us slightly different results.
- We're not sure if this is because we're estimating different underlying population parameters or because of noise/unobserved heterogeneity.
- So we measure the variance of our attacks and decide to pool or not-pool based off this.

### Hierarchical Model IV
- By specifying hyperpriors for both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we have a varying slope and varying intercept model.
    + Traditional fixed effects would be sort of analogous to a varying intercept model.
- Methods like this are often used when we have several separate experiments trying to estimate roughly the same effect.
    + e.g. pooling multiple minimum wage studies to improve our minimum wage estimates or testing the external validity of multiple RCTs answering the same research question.
    


# Data
### Terror Data
- Using UK terror data from the Global Terrorism Database compiled by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland.
    + Includes a range of variables such as wounded, killed, property damage, target, perpetrator group, ideology and weapon used.
    + Incredibly granular data with information ranging from weapon subtype (was a shotgun, handgun or hands and fists used for instance) to target subtype (was the target a telecommunications facility or military installation)
- There have been 3041 attacks since 1980 in the UK.
- However, when screening for overlapping events this falls to ~100.
- I present results using both a screened and overlapping dataset.
- This is the same dataset used by Brodeur in his forthcoming paper exploring economic costs of terror in US states.

### Index Data

- Daily index return data from Thomson Reuters.
- Results reported using FTSE All-Share unless specified otherwise.
    + Robustness checks performed using a range of alternative indices.
- Financial data is known to have fat tails.
- I use Trapani (2016)'s test for (in)finite fourth moments with a few adaptations and find that I can reject the null of an infinite fourth moment with $p < 10^{-11}$.
- Price data is shown to be non-stationary but transforming to return data (i.e. log-differencing) gives a stationary, I(1), process.

### Brief Summary

- The individual event studies indicate that maybe something is going on here - but it's very tenuous.
- When I aggregate up into CAARs this disappears.
- The conditional probability method seems to come to broadly similar conclusions.
- The hierarchical model offers an improvement over the pooled and separate models but it still only points to 2 extreme events and an additional abnormal event.
- Can we do better by looking at the makeup of terror events in more detail?

# Model Extensions
### Event Heterogeneity - The 'No' Slide

- Can we estimate the determinants of terror responses?
    + Do bombings have greater impacts than shootings?
    + Are lone wolf attacks different to attacks organised by a terror cell?
- Can we find evidence that reconciles the differences between the 5 'largest' attacks and the rest?

### Some Issues
- After events have been screened to remove overlap I have ~100 events.
- I have somewhere between 70-100 predictors depending on exact specification used.
- OLS typically doesn't fare too well at estimation under these conditions.
- I need to either increase N or reduce K.
    + Two approaches: relax screening assumptions and/or perform variable selection.
    
### Bayesian LASSO

- Two ways to do this:
    + Estimate traditional OLS with a regularisation parameter and use generic, weak priors (something like N(0,5)).
    + Use a hierarchical shrinkage model with Laplace priors on the regression parameters, Park & Casella (2008).
  
![Fahrmeir, L., Kneib, T. & Konrath, S. Stat Comput (2010) 20: 203](C:/Users/ed/Documents/R Working Directory/EME-Dissertation/Presentation and Plots/R/plots/LASSO and Ridge Priors.png)

### Horseshoe and Horseshoe+ priors

- I can go a few steps further than just aping the frequentist LASSO.
- HS and HS+ priors are another attempt at handling sparsity and variable selection Carvalho et al. (2009), Bhadra et al. (2015).
- They seem to perform better than the LASSO at regularising outliers amongst other things.
- The horseshoe:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\beta_i &\sim N(0, \lambda_i^2\tau^2) \\
\lambda_i &\sim C^+(0, 1) \\
\tau &\sim C^+(0, \tau_0^2) \\
\boldsymbol{y} &\sim N(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma_y^2)
\end{aligned}
$$


- Where $\tau_0$ is a function of our expected number of relevant predictors and some other stuff, Piironen & Vehtari (2017).


### The Horseshoe+
- Pretty similar but I add a half-Cauchy 'mixing' variable:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\beta_i &\sim N(0, \lambda_i^2\tau^2) \\
\lambda_i &\sim C^+(0, \eta_i) \\
\eta_i &\sim C^+(0, 1)\\
\tau &\sim C^+(0, \tau_0^2) \\
\boldsymbol{y} &\sim N(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma_y^2)
\end{aligned}
$$

- This improves on the HS's ability to detect signals when signals are 'ultra-sparse'.
- Basically the HS+ has heavier tails and more mass near the origin so you get the best of both worlds in setting stuff to 0 and detecting outliers (i.e. relevant variables).

# Conclusion
###


- Very large events on the whole negatively impact markets but effects disappear quickly as I move from larger to smaller events.
- Pinning down these 'large' events statistically instead of heuristically isn't going too hot right now.

### To Do:

- Look at interaction terms?
- Add a time trend?
- Aggregate up and reduce variables manually?
- Conclude that asset markets are very resilient to terror attacks in the short-term.
    + Are attacks already priced in?
    + Has there been a change over time?
    + What about LT effects?
